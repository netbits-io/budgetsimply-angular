# budgetsimply.io sources (old angular version)

This is the initial version of budgetsimply.io. It uses AngularJS 1.4 and a Node.js/Express/Mongoose backend.
The code is just a unfinished proof of concept. It has lots of bugs but the basic functionality is working.

It will not be developed any further since I am switching budgetsimply.io to React.js.


## Built With

[AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [JWT](https://jwt.io/), ...
